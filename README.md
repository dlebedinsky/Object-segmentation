# Object-segmentation
Final project for Harvard's Deep Learning course. I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect object outlines within an image, optimized to prevent overfitting, and visualized layer activations.

# Installation
This project is intended to be run in Google Colab, as it is the most cost-effective platform given the size of the training dataset. At the top of each notebook in src/ is a cell containing the os.chdir function and a base directory variable. Modify the paths to correspond to the Google Drive directory you saved them in. Make sure GPU runtime is enabled for each of the notebooks.
